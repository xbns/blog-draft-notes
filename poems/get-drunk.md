Always be drunk.That's it! <br>
The great imperative! <br>
In order not to feel Time's horrid fardel bruise your shoulders,grinding you into the earth,</br>
Get drunk and stay that way.<br>
On what?<br>
On wine,poetry,virtue,whatever. <br>

<p>
But get drunk <br>
And if you sometimes happen to wake up,on the porches <br>
of a palace,in the green grass of a ditch,in the dismal loneliness of your own room, <br>
</p>

<p>
You drunkeness gone or disappearing,ask the wind, the wave,the star, the bird, the clock. <br>
Ask everything that flees,everything that groans or rolls or sings,everything that speaks. <br>
Ask what time it is; and the wind, the wave,the star,the bird,the clock will answer you; <br>
"Time to get drunk!" <br>
</p>

<p>
Don't be martyred slaves of time, <br>
Get Drunk! <br>
Stay Drunk! <br>
On wine,virtue,poerty,whatever! <br>
</p>

-Charles Baudelaire(France)
