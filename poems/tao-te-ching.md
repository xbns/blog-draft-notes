<p>
Stop thinking, and end your problems. <br>
What is difference between yes and no? <br>
What is the difference between success and failure?<br>
Must you value what others value,<br>
avoid what others avoid? <br>
How ridiculous!<br>
</p>
<p>
Other people are excited <br>
as though they were at a parade <br>
I alone don't care <br>
I alone am expressionless <br>
like an infant before it can smile. <br>
</p>
<p>
Other people have what they need; <br>
I alone possess nothing <br>
I alone drift about <br>
like someone without a home <br>
I am like an idiot, my mind is so empty. <br>
</p>
<p>
Other people are bright <br>
I alone am dark <br>
Other people are sharp;<br>
I alone am dull, <br>
Other people have a purpose <br>
I alone don't know <br>
I drift like a wave on the ocean <br>
I bow as aimless as the wind. <br>
</p>

<p>
I am different from ordinary people <br>
I drink from the Great Mother's breasts. <br>
</p>
- Lao Tzu (China)
