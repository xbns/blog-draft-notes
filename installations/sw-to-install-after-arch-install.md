### 3 Install Nemo Plugins
Nemo is the default file manager for cinnamon but you may need to install the following plugins.

```bash
# pacman -S nemo-fileroller nemo-preview
```
- nemo-fileroller - support compressed file formats (zip, tar, gz)
- nemo-preview - press the spacebar to view a preview of the selected file.

i usually install `zip` and `unrar` separately incase i may want to purge everything nemo in future and use windows manager like `i3`.

For uncompressing `tar.gz` files, `bstar` comes installed by default in arch.
